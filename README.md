Each file inside the src folder is designed for a certain purpose, here are the uses for each file:
LinkedList.py -> A DOUBLE-Linked List algorithm
Node.py -> Node Class for editing if you want to change how a node works although this will affect ALL node based data structures in this project so be careful!
Logger.py -> A text-file based logger that prints a severity, date, time, line, file, and you can add messages to the "Logger.log()" function.
